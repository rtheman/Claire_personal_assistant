# ü§ñ Cl(ai)re ‚Äì AI Appointment Scheduling Assistant

Cl(ai)re is a friendly, voice-enabled AI assistant built to handle appointment scheduling, rescheduling, cancellations, and weather inquiries‚Äîentirely over voice. Designed with minimal code using modern tools like [ElevenLabs AI Agents](https://elevenlabs.io/), Cal.com APIs, and webhook integrations, Claire showcases how powerful, human-like assistants can be created without writing complex backend logic.

Currently, you can find this on bottom-right of [rtheman.com](rtheman.com), which looks something like this:

## üß† About This Project

**Cl(ai)re** acts as a conversational agent for booking and managing appointments through natural, voice-based interaction. It speaks **English and German** natively and responds with clarity, charm, and a bit of wit‚Äîperfect for both professional and casual contexts.

This project highlights how **low-code/no-code platforms** paired with thoughtful **system architecture and prompt design** can produce real-world, production-grade AI solutions.



## üí° Why This Matters

Even as a seasoned data scientist and ML strategist, I wanted to demonstrate that **powerful AI systems don‚Äôt need to start with code**. This project proves:
- You can build intelligent assistants using voice, logic, APIs, and prompt engineering
- Conversational UX matters as much as backend logic
- No need to reinvent the wheel when excellent platforms like ElevenLabs and Cal.com exist

## ü§ñ System Prompt
This AI agent prompt defines how **Claire**, the voice-enabled appointment assistant, behaves, speaks, and handles scheduling tasks. It acts as the foundation for repeatable, explainable performance across all caller interactions.

Details of system prompt can be found [here](./Main%20Agent%20System%20Prompt).


## üß© Key Features

### üóìÔ∏è Intelligent Scheduling
Cl(ai)re can:
- Check availability (`get_Available_Slots`)
- Book new appointments (`Book_Appointment`)
- Reschedule existing appointments (`reschedule_appointment`)
- Cancel appointments (`cancel_appointment`)
- Lookup current bookings (`find_appointment`)

### ‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Forecasting
Cl(ai)re fetches real-time weather forecasts based on appointment location and time (`get_weather`), offering:
- Current weather summaries
- 3‚Äì14 day forecasts
- Friendly alerts for extreme weather

### üë• Natural Voice & Bilingual UX
- Bilingual support (English üá∫üá∏ & German üá©üá™)
- Voice responses use conversational filler phrases like:
  - ‚ÄúLet me check that real quick‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúHmm, looks like that time‚Äôs taken‚Äîshall we try another?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúAwesome, we‚Äôre all set!‚Äù

# üî≠ Next Steps & Future Project Plan

To build on Claire‚Äôs current capabilities and infrastructure, the following future enhancements are planned:

## 1. üß† Migrate to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Current State:** Claire interacts with external services like Cal.com and WeatherAPI.com using custom HTTP tools.

**Planned Upgrade:** Replace these isolated API services with a **unified MCP layer** that enables structured, secure, and efficient access to services such as:
- Gmail (for reading/responding to emails)
- Google Drive (for accessing/storing files)
- Weather forecast via Google's ecosystem

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Cleaner system flow by calling a **single callable MCP endpoint** instead of multiple APIs.
- üöÄ Easier to scale and manage access control.
- üîç More observable & secure interactions with OAuth-based Google Services.
- üß™ Personal learning: Gain firsthand experience with the emerging best practices around MCP integrations.

---

## 2. üîÑ Refactor Voice Agent Backend from ElevenLabs to N8N

**Current State:** ElevenLabs manages voice synthesis and agent operations.

**Planned Upgrade:** Refactor backend flows to use **[N8N](https://n8n.io)** for task orchestration and webhook-driven flows.

**Benefits:**
- üß© Unified platform for API orchestration, scheduling, and webhook flows.
- üí° Simplifies debugging and flow visualization for non-technical stakeholders.
- üí¨ Greater control over execution logic and retry mechanisms.
- üîÑ Enables automation pipelines beyond voice‚Äîe.g., notification logic, multi-channel comms.

# üí° Lessons Learned
*as of 2025-06-25*

## 1. üîÅ Repeatability vs Flexibility

AI Agents thrive when grounded in structure. But building Claire raised this question:  
> ‚ÄúHow do we strike the right balance between **framework-driven system prompts** and **freeform design** for creativity?‚Äù

**Takeaway:**  
Crafting reusable agents often means defining clear components (Role, Voice & Persona, Tasks, Tools, etc.), but leaving room for adaptation through modular sub-prompts or dynamic memory. Best practices suggest:
- Define a **core template** but allow for prompt chaining.
- Use variable blocks (like `{{user_context}}`) to enable flexible persona shaping
- Avoid over-engineering; start with functional structure, then let the agent iterate

---

## 2. üîç Explainability & Interpretability

Much like ML models, AI agents can exhibit **opaque behavior**. Hallucinations are just one layer.

**Takeaway:**  
- Treat prompts like **input parameters**‚Äîsmall changes matter
- Log agent thoughts, message history, tool usage
- Borrow from **LIME/SHAP-style concepts** in ML to probe prompt sensitivity
- Implement **controlled testing** (e.g., prompt A/B tests, agent trace logs)

---

## 3. ‚òéÔ∏è Voice Agent Acceptance (Inbound vs Outbound)

**Context matters** when deploying voice agents:

- ‚ùå **Outbound Call**: Users expect empathy, improvisation, and exploration. AI here may feel pushy or inadequate.
- ‚úÖ **Inbound Call**: For transactional use-cases like booking appointments or checking status, AI is welcome‚Äîespecially when:
  - It‚Äôs faster than a human
  - Offers 24/7 availability
  - Doesn‚Äôt judge or get tired
  - Benefits vendors *and* consumers

**Takeaway:**  
Design voice agents to **complement**, not replace. Always **disclose AI nature** early, and offer escalation to human fallback when context demands depth, nuance, or emotional intelligence.
