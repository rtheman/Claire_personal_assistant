# 🤖 Cl(ai)re – AI Appointment Scheduling Assistant

Cl(ai)re is a friendly, voice-enabled AI assistant built to handle appointment scheduling, rescheduling, cancellations, and weather inquiries—entirely over voice. Designed with minimal code using modern tools like [ElevenLabs AI Agents](https://elevenlabs.io/), Cal.com APIs, and webhook integrations, Claire showcases how powerful, human-like assistants can be created without writing complex backend logic.



## 🧠 About This Project

**Cl(ai)re** acts as a conversational agent for booking and managing appointments through natural, voice-based interaction. It speaks **English and German** natively and responds with clarity, charm, and a bit of wit—perfect for both professional and casual contexts.

This project highlights how **low-code/no-code platforms** paired with thoughtful **system architecture and prompt design** can produce real-world, production-grade AI solutions.



## 💡 Why This Matters

Even as a seasoned data scientist and ML strategist, I wanted to demonstrate that **powerful AI systems don’t need to start with code**. This project proves:
- You can build intelligent assistants using voice, logic, APIs, and prompt engineering
- Conversational UX matters as much as backend logic
- No need to reinvent the wheel when excellent platforms like ElevenLabs and Cal.com exist
